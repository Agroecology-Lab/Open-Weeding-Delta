# Nindamani-the-weed-removal-robot

Nindamani, the AI based mechanically weed removal robot, which autonomously detects and segment the weeds from crop using artificial intelligence. The whole robot modules natively build on ROS2. Nindamani can be used in any early stage of crops for autonomous weeding.

In this following repository, you will find instructions for software installation and control mechanism for Nindamani robot.

# Features:
